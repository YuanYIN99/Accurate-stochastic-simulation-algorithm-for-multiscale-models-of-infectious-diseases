This directory includes:
1. simulated multiscale system dynamics using approximate time-driven and our novel exact algorithms (.mat files). 
2. .m files to produce Figures in the Result section of the paper;
3. jpg result figures.

Note: for the .mat files, the ones with 'Setup' in the file name stores the parameters used for simulation; whilst the ones  with 'RunsDeltas' records the dynamics.
